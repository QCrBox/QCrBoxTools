# QCrBoxTools

The QCrBox project requires the ability to automatically run included programs within their container to reproduce previously run containers.

This mainly includes file conversion from and to cif, as well as. "robots" to run the programs themselves. As this might be functionality with use cases outside of QCrBox the code will be hosted here.
